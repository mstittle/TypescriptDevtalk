## TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript/ES6 but like Java or C# it allows you to define new types. Declaring variables with types rather than the generic vars enables better tooling support: syntax checking and code refactoring. These type annotations are compiled away by the code generation process and have no runtime impact. TypeScript also tracks and implements current and future ECMAScript standards like ES6 and the new features from ES7 like decorators. Even though TypeScript came out of Microsoft it is an open source project hosted on GitHub with an Apache style license. Notably the Angular 2 team has chosen TypeScript as the core language for Angular2. TypeScript also supports 3rd party JavaScript libraries by using type definitions that add type annotations for many popular JavaScript libraries.
